# Deep-Learning---Digit-Recognition

This repository contains a simple neural network model implemented in TensorFlow and Keras for recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset.


## Overview
In this project, we build and train a neural network model to classify handwritten digits (0-9) using the popular MNIST dataset. The model is implemented using the Keras API in TensorFlow and consists of a simple architecture involving a flattening layer and two dense layers.


### Prerequisites
Before running the code, ensure you have the following dependencies installed:
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow
- NumPy (usually included with TensorFlow)


### Installation
pip install tensorflow numpy


### Usage
Open and run the dl_script.py notebook to see the step-by-step implementation and training of the neural network.
You can also modify the model architecture, hyperparameters, and training settings to experiment with different configurations.

### Results
After training, the model's accuracy and loss on the testing dataset will be displayed. You can evaluate the model's performance on unseen handwritten digit images.


###Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you find any issues or have suggestions for improvements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
